/// This library is intended to provide a busy-wait delay
/// similar to the one provided by the arduino c++ utilities
/// If you need accurate time keeping you should consider a
/// hardware timer.

// This library does all of the busy-wait loop in rust.
// We pack as much of the looping as possible into asm!
// so that we can count cycles.
//
// Ignoring the overhead, which may be significant:
// An arduino runs at 16MHZ. Each asm loop is 4 cycles.
// so each loop is 0.25 us.
//
// the overhead of delay() seems to be about 13 cycles
// initially, and then 11 cycles per outer loop. We ignore
// all that.

/// Internal function to implement a variable busy-wait loop.
/// # Arguments
/// * 'count' - an i32, the number of times to cycle the loop.
